  {
    question: "Do you have puppies available?",
    answer:
      "We breed infrequently and intentionally — typically one litter every two to three years. All litters are planned well in advance with specific breeding goals. We maintain a waitlist and encourage interested families to reach out early.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the adoption process?",
    answer:
      "We begin with an application and extended conversation. We want to understand your lifestyle, experience with primitive breeds, and expectations. We are equally happy to answer your questions about us. Our goal is a mutual fit that lasts the lifetime of the dog.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are Shikoku Ken good family dogs?",
    answer:
      "They can be, for the right family. Shikoku are loyal, intelligent, and deeply bonded to their people. They are not, however, easy dogs. They require experienced handling, consistent boundaries, and an understanding of primitive breed behavior. They are not golden retrievers in a different coat.",
  },
  {
    question: "What health testing do you perform?",
    answer:
      "All breeding dogs receive OFA hip and patella evaluations, OFA eye exams, and GM1 Gangliosidosis DNA testing at minimum. We believe comprehensive health testing is a non-negotiable foundation of responsible breeding.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship puppies?",
    answer:
      "We prefer in-person pickup and strongly encourage families to visit us before and after the litter arrives. For the right home at a distance, we will discuss travel arrangements on a case-by-case basis. We do not cargo ship puppies.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of a Shikoku Ken puppy?",
    answer:
      "We are happy to discuss pricing with approved applicants. Our pricing reflects the investment in health testing, proper care, socialization, and the considerable effort involved in preservation breeding a rare breed.",
